// UVa 12502 - Three Families.cpp
// Beware this is one of those annoyingly clever problems on UVa. The problem statement is confusing (on purpose) - and 
// then if you use floating point numbers you'll likely end up getting a WA.

// In regards to the problem statement: What's not made very clear is that the families do not get paid for their own share of the work.
// Family C is paying Family A and B only for work that Family C did not do.
// On the floating point front, think a little outside the box. Maybe a change in time units, perhaps.
